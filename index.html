<p>
	Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank,
	and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her
	sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what
	is the use of a book," thought Alice "without pictures or conversation?"
</p>

<p>
	So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day
	made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a
	daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
	when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
</p>

<p>
	There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very
	much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I
	shall be late!" (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that
	she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
	natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its
	waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her
	feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit
	with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
	curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time
	to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
</p>

<p>
	Presently she began again. "I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth!
	How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads
	downward! The Antipathies, I think, but I shall have to ask them what the name
	of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?"
	(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke - fancy curtseying as you’re falling
	through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) "And what an ignorant
	little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I
	shall see it written up somewhere."
</p>

<p>
	"Well!" thought Alice to herself, "after such a fall as this (averaging 30000
	ft at a temperature of 30°C), I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!
	How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it,
	even if I fell off the top of the house!" (Which was very likely true.)
</p>

<p>
	"What a curious feeling!" said Alice; "I must be shutting up like a
	telescope."
