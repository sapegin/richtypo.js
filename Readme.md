Richtypo prepares your texts to publication on web: applies typography rules like quotes (`"` → `“”`), dashes (`-` → `—`) and non-breaking spaces to make text easier to read.

Richtypo comes with [typography rules](#rule-packages) for English, French and Russian, but you can customize them and create your own rules — each rule is an independent JavaScript function.

Have a look at [the example page](https://sapegin.github.io/richtypo.js/) and [its source](https://github.com/sapegin/richtypo.js/tree/master/example/src).
