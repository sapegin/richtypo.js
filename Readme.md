# Richtypo: typography enhancer for Node.js

The main purpose of this library is to enhance typography of your HTML. It supposes that your texts already have right
quotes, dashes and other symbols (you can use [Typography Keyboard Layout](http://ilyabirman.net/typography-layout/)).
Richtypo adds non-breaking spaces in right places, adds CSS classes for abbreviations, ampersands and hanging
punctuation for special styling.


## Features

- Rules for English and Russian languages
- Non-breaking spaces after prepositions and conjunctions, before em-dash, etc.
- `<nobr>` for words with hyphens
- CSS classes for abbreviations, ampersands and hanging punctuation
- Takes care of your HTML tags
- Simple typographer (quotes, em-dash, etc.) for user generated content (e.g. comments)


## Example

```javascript
var richtypo = require('richtypo');
var beautiful = richtypo.rich('Welcome to the world of beautiful web typography — only with Richtypo.');
var awesome = richtypo.title('Beautiful &amp; Awesome Web Typography with “Richtypo”');
```

Will produce something like that:

```html
Welcome to&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;beautiful web typography&nbsp;— only with Richtypo.
Beautiful <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Awesome Web Typography with <span class="slaquo"> </span> <span class="hlaquo">“</span>Richtypo”'
```


## Installation

```bash
$ npm install richtypo
```


## Usage / API

### Text processing: common use cases

```javascript
richtypo.rich(text, lang)  // Enhancing typography: non-breaking spaces, abbreviations
richtypo.title(text, lang)  // Typography for big text: the same as rich + ampersands and hanging punctuation
richtypo.lite(text, lang)  // Simple typographer (quotes, em-dash, etc.) for user generated content (e.g. comments)
```

- `text` is an HTML string;
- `lang` (_optional_) is a text language (`'en'` or `'ru'`).

### Text processing: custom set of rules

```javascript
richtypo.richtypo(text, rulesets, lang)
```

- `text` is a HTML string;
- `rulesets` is array of rulesets (available rulesets: `'save_tags'`, `'cleanup_before'`, `'spaces_lite'`, `'spaces_lite'`,
  `'spaces'`, `'abbrs'`, `'amps'`, `'hanging'`, `'cleanup_after'`, `'restore_tags'`);
- `lang` (_optional_) is a text language (`'en'` or `'ru'`).

### Change language globally

```javascript
richtypo.lang(lang)
```

- `lang` is a language (`'en'` or `'ru'`).
